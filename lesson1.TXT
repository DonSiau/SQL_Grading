Lesson1 problem1
Let's see the answer. 
Now we want to see the title of book. 
So we can write "SELECT title" 
And we can extract title from book database. 
Then we can write "book". 
Lastly, we want to extract title of book which are out of stock. 
When the value of "quantity_available" is 0 ,it means out of stock. 
So it is what we want to know. 
Then we can write "WHERE qunatity_available = 0;" or "WHERE quantity_available=1". 

Lesson2 problem2 
Now we are going to extract name and address of publishers located outside of USA. 
As explained earlier, you can select publisher_name and publisher_address. 
And you can select database. 
Now we have to extract publisher by using WHERE phrase. 
We want to know publisher which is not located in usa. 
Do you want to write all of country in the world except for usa? 
We have other solutions. 
'!'means not equal. 
So you can write"WHERE publisher_country != "usa";" 

Lesson3 problem3
Now we have to extract data by using two or more informations. 
so we have to use "AND", "OR" phrase. 
The first we can extract information of book which is not written in English by using  WHERE language "english". 
But we need to narrow down the information. 
Then we can use AND phrase. 
The information should meet both conditions. 
OR phrase means the information should meet at least one condition. 
So we can write "AND (type = "ebook" OR type = "audio");"
